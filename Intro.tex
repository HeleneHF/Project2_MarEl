\end{itemize}

Configuration:

Propulsion:
In order to fulfill the power and manoeuvrability requirements after the worst-case failure, it is considered a minimum of two operating segregations needed. Then the power demand will be 17 MW for for each thruster. During normal operation (42 MW power demand) the load factor will be 0.618 0.824 with 4 or 3 thrusters in service respectively. 

Generation:
For supplying the power demands in both \textit{worst-case failure} and \textit{normal operation} 8 20 M
