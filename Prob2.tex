\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{2a)}

In order to fulfill the Equipment Class 3 required by the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (as specified in \nameref{problem_1a}) and in accordance to the DNV GL regulations \ref{Sec:Equivalent_Notations} \cite{RecommendedPractices_DP_DNVGL}, the notation will be DYNPOS(AUTRO). The tables in appendix \ref{Sec:Equipment_Requirements} and \ref{Sec:Class_Notations} specifies the DNV GL requirements for each part of the system that is needed to be classed as DYNPOS(AUTRO). 

Such notation sets as a design requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Redundancy of all active components (classification societies interpret this differently).
    \item Physical separation of the components.
    \item Time to terminate: Be able to maintain station long enough to safely terminate the work in progress after a \textit{single failure}.
    \item The equipment intended to provide redundancy is available immediately and with a minimum of operator intervention.
    \item Adequate remaining power and thrust after a \textit{worst-case failure}
\end{itemize}
